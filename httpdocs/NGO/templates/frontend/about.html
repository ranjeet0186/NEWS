              <p>I do not believe one can settle how much we ought to give. I am afraid the only safe rule is to give
                more than we can spare. In other words, if our expenditure on comforts, luxuries, amusements, etc, is up
                to the standard common among those with the same income as our own, we are probably giving away too
                little. If our charities do not at all pinch or hamper us, I should say they are too small. There ought
                to be things we should like to do and cannot do because our charitable expenditure excludes them.</p>
